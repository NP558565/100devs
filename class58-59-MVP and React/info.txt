Hey @everyone

PLEASE keep your eye on how far you have come! From struggling with tags in HTML, trying to get things centered in CSS,  understanding what a function is, building up to objects and classes, battling through codewars, building servers with RAW http and fs modules, learning express, adding MongoDB into the mix, creating FULLSTACK APPs with authentication, now building fullstack apps of your own, and finally getting all your professional skills in place to start the glory that is THE HUNT next week! 

Now Today is the day! Your Beautiful MVPs are due! I know so many of you are so close, but need just a little more time. SO, we are going to do a quick stream to celebrate how far we have come and then you'll have the rest of the evening to make the deadline. We'll start React on Thursday! 

NO CHECKIN! - we want to start spacing things out too to throw off the scent!
