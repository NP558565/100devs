Hey @everyone

We are going to go live for a quick stream to talk through MVPs, see some examples, talk through how to get some quick design/style wins to make yours look Beautiful by TUESDAY, and then start working together!

Also, at this point it is just getting ridiculous... check all the jobs in the üéâcelebrations channel ü•≥ 

NO CHECKIN! - we want to start spacing things out too to throw off the scent!

Hey @everyone 

I'm still recovering from being sick this past week and was hoping my voice would recover by now. 

Unfortunately, I don't think I could make it through the second half of our Super Review Tomorrow. We'll have to postpone until next Sunday. 

Best of luck finishing your beautiful MVPs and I'm excited to get into REACT this week!
