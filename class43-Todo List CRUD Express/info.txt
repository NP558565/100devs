Hey @everyone

Unfortunately, I can't hold class tonight. I need just a little more time to adjust my family schedule, but we should be set going forward. Please take this time to work on the homework and work on your daily goals (BANKI, Code Challenge, & Networking).

Though I haven't been able to go live, I've been working hard on the end of program so that we can make up the time and finish strong! Really excited to dig deeper into CRUD, get you interview ready, and I have A LOT planned to help you on THE HUNT. 

You are missed, sorry for the delay, and see you on Tuesday!
