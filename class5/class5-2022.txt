I know this was a long one! Thank you for giving me some time to jump into layout with yall. We'll get plenty more practice in on Thursday! Also, TW for ED: Sorry for the over the top vomiting imagery, I did not think about its impact on folx with eating disorders. I won't use those gifs going forward!  Have a great rest of your day and excited to see your layouts next class!
