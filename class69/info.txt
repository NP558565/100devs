Hey @everyone 

🚨 We are going to push our last class to Thursday. 🚨 
(Also, no standup today)

My apologies for the poor timing on my part because today is voting day in the US. I can't make folx choose between celebrating something they've worked so hard on for months and making the decisions that literally decide the future for them and their loved ones.

Please vote, and I'll see you on Thursday for our official last class. 😢

Hey @everyone 

Our WILD WEEK starts today with MONSTER MONDAY! :ricflair: 

The first wave of 🎃huntober2022-standup responses will start going out in small batches today. If you completed the form and don't receive an email today, please don't panic it is on it's way. I just want to make sure everything works smoothly and they will roll out over today, tomorrow, and Wed! 

You will be receiving a shiny completion cert (feel free to burn for warmth), a letter of support from me highlighting your achievements during your time at 100Devs, access to our exclusive job board (more companies coming), access to our seeking freelancer list (were clients can post their jobs for free and hopefully you grab a few extra clients), and entrance into the cool kids club that is #📚house-turing! IF YOU MISSED IT NO WORRIES, WAVE 002 opens WEDNESDAY (more info then)!

Also, the schedule this week is changing up a little! 

Content Note (children): Unfortunately, I was back in the ER with the little one all weekend and I'm just getting back from follow ups ect (they are happy and healthy - just tired), so

💰  We are pushing the Microsoft sponsored stream to #FUNDTHEAGENCY to Thursday! 💰 

The GOAT OF ALL GOATS @Mayanwolfe (Stream Team) is stepping up two days early to host their PostgreSQL Class Tomorrow! 

We'll start out on https://www.twitch.tv/learnwithleon at 6:30pm ET so I can kick of the festivities and raffle off some free exclusive #FUNDTHEAGENCY Merch and then raid @Mayanwolfe (Stream Team) for A GLORIOUS Intro to PostgreSQL NOT TO BE MISSED! 

Wed. Agency site goes live, feedback, and #100Maintainer Surveys go out & I'll be sharing more #100Maintainer's info after standup! 

No standup today, but we'll meet tomorrow normal time 6pm before going live on Twitch!
