// Variables
/*You are getting ready to face Brock for the Boulder Badge. You want three pokemon on your team that 
each have evolved at least once. You have bulbasaur which is at level 5 and evolves at level 16, 
caterpie which is at level 1 and evolves at level 7, and weedle which is at level 1 and evolves at 
level 7. Create three variables to store the number of rare candies each of your pokemon would need 
to evolve (rare candies increase your level by one). Finally, create a fourth variable named totalCandies
 that sums all the rare candies you would need.*/

let totalCandies = bulbasaurCandies + caterpieCandies + weedleCandies

//Conditionals And Functions

celcius. Create one function that converts a Fahrenheit value to Celcius and another fuction that tells 
you wheither or not charmander can battle*/
