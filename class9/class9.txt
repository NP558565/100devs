Hope you had some fun tonight and got to meet some wonderful people! I know Remo can be finicky and I hope you didn't get #shufflelocked, but we'll try out other platforms in the future and get lots more "networking" practice in as the cohort continues. Really excited for Thursday and if you feel a little behind on all the layouts IT IS THE CLASS FOR YOU!

Also, feels really weird to not end with a raid, so let's raid @mewtru 's Youtube Video on Networking!: https://youtu.be/_CIJ_44IxRg
If we get them over 1k subs, I'll raffle some free #100Devs merch during Thursday's class
