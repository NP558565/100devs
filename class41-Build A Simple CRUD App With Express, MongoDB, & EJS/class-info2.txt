Hey @everyone! I've snuck my way into this channel to let you know that even though we're on a break, I miss you all and will be hopping ON THE STAGE right here on the Discord tomorrow, Tuesday, at 6pm Eastern for an hour to talk through PREP and help you get some practice before those technical interviews start rolling in.

Hope to see you then!

Hey @everyone 

Over break my wife and I had a secret mission. We brought a beautiful baby into the world. I had planned on resuming our classes today, but unfortunately yesterday while swaddled and on their back they stopped breathing. We had a small bluetooth device that was monitoring them and let us know things were not okay. I picked up their limp body and tried to rouse them. It didn’t work and we called 911. I was put on fuckin hold… We rushed to our car and my wife continued CPR. Luckily in the middle of a busy L.A. street they started crying again and a group of Firefighters / EMTs met us and rushed them to the ER. They are stable and all of the big scary tests are coming back with everything looking great, but we’ll be in intensive care for some time. I had planned on keeping this part of my life private, but I think there is something really important to share here. A little piece of tech saved my little one's life… and while we are here to get the bag and unlock a wonderful career you all have a REAL FUCKING SUPER POWER. I’ll take all your prayers, well wishes, and good vibes, but those are for my baby. For me, I would love if you took this week to put your super powers into action. PLEASE BUILD SOMETHING that helps others. A simple informational website, a web app that helps, or anything your skills can muster. Know that your skills have value and you could build something that makes someone's day just a little safer, easier, or better.

You are missed and loved,
Leon & Baby

Hey @everyone 

The outpouring of support and love following @Leon's message on Tuesday was beautiful to see. I hope you’re all taking his message to heart and working on creating something that helps others and brings some good into this world! 

Though class is on hold this week, @dvkr (on hiatus) and I will be going live at 6:30pm Eastern tonight for an hour on the stage, right here on the Discord, to talk all things 100 hours project. We’ll be discussing what the 100 hours project is, answering common questions surrounding it, and sharing the reality of how it was to work on ours. We’re also hoping to hear some of the ideas you have and will be answering your questions (or trying to!). 

We hope you can join us!
