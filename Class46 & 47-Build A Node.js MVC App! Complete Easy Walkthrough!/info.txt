Hey @everyone 

Thanks for hanging through the first pass of MVC. For homework please build out a lecture on MVC! This practice will serve you well on the job! You'll join a team. Look at the codebase and see so many new things that you have to get up to speed on quickly! Take this time to practice that skillset and I'll see you on Thursday to help make things make sense + dive deeper into the code that will be the spring board for your projects going forward! 

1. Manage Frustration
2. Be Consistent
3. Take Care Of Yourself 

YOU GOT THIS!

Hey @everyone 

We've got some more MVC TO DO! Let's take a look at updating, deleting, using datasets, and how the whole codebase FUNCTIONS ::: dad jokes intensify ::: !
