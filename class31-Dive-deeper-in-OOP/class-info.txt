Hey @everyone 

BREATH! That was a lot of info to get through in 3 hours. You should be proud of seeing it through and giving your brain a workout! 

PLEASE review, play, and break the code we went over tonight. Get lost in it, come with questions, and come ready to review on Thursday. 

We only have one more topic to go: Async / Await / Promises and then we are ready to shift gears and move into the backend! So excited for you to see how unscary the backend can be, and for you to be able to build full stack apps! 

I know this stuff is tough! Hang in there, and we'll make it to the end. Much Love!
