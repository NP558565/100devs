Hey @everyone 

On Thursday chat exploded with I want this and I will help! Let's live those two ideals and ease back into class with a project night starting at 6:30pm ET (normal class time)! 

Please take tonight to work with others and comment every line of this of this Todo List: https://github.com/100devs/todo-list-express
Work together to understand each line and support folx when things don't make sense right away! 

We'll be building this todo list live during Thursdays class, but I want everyone to have the chance to work through the code before then. Also, I'll ask you to submit your commented code on Thursday. I'll pick one person who submits and complete the first half of their HITLIST for them live during a future class! I'll find the jobs, write the intro messages, and get your HUNT started RIGHT! 

Here are the links to our classrooms for working on the project in 60mins:
