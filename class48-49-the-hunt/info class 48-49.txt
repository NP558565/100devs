:pikahello:  Class-48 of #100Devs starts in 60 minutes (6:30pm ET) live on Twitch: https://leonnoel.com/twitch


I got the job!! I‚Äôll start my first role as a software developer next month. Thank you @Leon and the #100Devs community for this truly life changing experience and opportunity. I can‚Äôt believe it. 100Devs you‚Äôve got this! It‚Äôs possible üíó #womenintech - https://twitter.com/alannac111/status/1560688418463461377

During this summer I took the opportunity to become a Software Developer Intern. Today, I received an offer letter and got promoted as a Software Developer 1. Thanks @Leon  and #100Devs for the amazing support. Let's go get! - https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735936014832369687/1011316023376478268

After being contacted by a inside recruiter and going through my first interview ever... I got the job as a Software Engineer! I am so happy. I can't believe it, because I totally felt like I could never get a job like that, felt like it was out of my reach. I will be making more than my father is making and he worked at one company for 10+ years. - https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/735936014832369687/1010214897474347018
