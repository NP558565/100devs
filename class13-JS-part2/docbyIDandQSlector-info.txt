document.getElementById() is already expecting an ID to be used here thats why the "#" isn't required.
When should you use onclick vs addeventlisterner 'click'? From what I understand onclick can only be used once right...so that element cant get assigned another event?

I think Leon was just showing multiple ways of accomplishing the same thing. addEventListener is more flexible, it can listen for "click", "dblclick",  "keyup", "keydown", "mouseover" to name a few. while onclick is limited to on click

document.querySelector() can select, elements, Classes, tags, attribute selectors, and any other way of selecting elements with CSS can be used so "." for classes and "#" for ids is important to include. 

.getElementsByClassName() can be called on any element, this is looking for a class name already so you don't need the "." but this function returns a HTMLCollection. which kinda like a live array, it can change if the DOM changes
