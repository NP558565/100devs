Hey @everyone

100Hours Project MVPs are due in one week aka next Tuesday! To give everyone some class time to finish, we won't meet on Twitch tonight! Remo will be open and also feel free to jump into voice channels in 60 minutes, so you are not working alone! #communitytaught

Remember if you want to participate in HUNTOBER, your MVP, client signature or grass roots volunteer or open source contribution are due on TUESDAY!

No Checkin - let's just get right to work :angryzoom: 

And here are the links to our classrooms for working on your BEAUTIFUL MVP:
