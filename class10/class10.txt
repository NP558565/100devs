Thank you for jumping the gap and being willing to carry the boats and the logs! Back to regular classes on Tuesday! No official office hours on Sunday, but we may still do a stream. 

Help channels will be closed for the next hour as the thread bot catches up! Please don't put your boats / logs in those channels. Thank you!
