Hey @everyone 

🎉 Happy New Year! Super excited to kick off the new year with standup today at 6:00pm ET here: https://live.remo.co/e/100devs-standup (we'll do Q&A since we are just returning from break before going deeper with recursion tomorrow!) 

Remember you can get daily standup reminders by clicking the 🎃 here: https://discord.com/channels/735923219315425401/1029499655874170910/1032022733057425490

We will have standup every day this week and #JOBUARY will officially start on Monday Jan. 9th! I want folx to have more time to make wave002 and to give companies a little more time to be back "in office". Expect a stream, talk, or event every day next week starting a little earlier at 5pm ET! 

:ricflair: Wave001 is now complete with all the certs, letters, job board invites, and freelancer signups having gone out plus follow up emails if you were missing anything!

:letmein: Wave002 is now open and the due date is extended until midnight PST on Friday Jan 6th: https://forms.gle/SJRaYGYZQB6uKCT98
(If you would like a shiny completion cert (to burn for warmth), a letter of support from me highlighting your achievements during your time at 100Devs, access to our exclusive job board (more companies coming), access to our seeking freelancer list (were clients can post their jobs for free and hopefully you grab a few extra clients), and entrance into the cool kids club that is #📚house-turing , please fill out this form)

Folx from wave001 & wave002 will be added to #📚house-turing at once wave002 completes this month. Then the game plan is to continue more waves each month! 

Also, I would really appreciate you filling out these surveys if you have not done so already. I want to make 100Devs the best it can be, but I need your help! 

The 2022 Feedback Survey: https://forms.gle/HRnaUa7qVtxnYSno9
(This survey really helps me understand how the past cohort went and what things can be improved. I review each submission and would appreciate you taking the time to fill it out.)

The #100Maintainers Survey: https://forms.gle/CLwEKgup5Ncrx2Ex8
(If there is anything you would like to do to support #100Devs with your time and sweat, I would appreciate you filling out this form.)

:pikahello: Thank you all for making last year so special. Pumped for what 2023 holds for all of us! See you in 90mins!

Hey @everyone 

My dear friend and founder of the non-profit I've helped build for the past 5+ years just put out a book called

What We Build With Power

It puts out the call to help disrupt the tech industry & build a more equitable workforce. It highlights the lessons we learned, and gives a deep dive into my pedagogy / the reason I do the things I do here at 100Devs. Ya boy shows up a few times through out the book and it would mean a lot if you helped me spread the word about our mission at Resilient Coders.

🔥 Here is my tweet about the book: https://twitter.com/leonnoel/status/1636822856599478274
(If you could like and retweet, I would really appreciate it. Also, I'll be purchasing and giving away 10 copies next week because WE'LL BE BACK LIVE ON TWITCH more to come...)
