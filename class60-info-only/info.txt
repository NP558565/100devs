Hey @everyone 

:pikahello: Classes 48 - 52 are now on Youtube! Add authentication to your Node Apps: https://youtu.be/z5UgtXOxEEk
Would appreciate a like and letting the video play to help the algorithm!


üí∞ Also, here is @Nicolas L template to negotiating a higher salary once you get an offer:

Hey [RECRUITER_NAME]! That sounds aweeesome! I really appreciate you going to bat for me and I'm really excited about this offer! I'm pretty deep in my interviewing with a few other companies right now like [name a few you got rejected from or interviewing now that this recruiter is unaware of] and I'm expecting offers from them around the [insert salary range ex: 95-120k]. I understand [COMPANY_NAME] is looking for someone in the [companies salary range ex: 90-95k], but if you were to send me on paper in an official offer letter a salary at [salary that would make you happy ex: 118k], I would shut down my search and go with this company immediately because it sounds like from both ends it would be a great fit!



Have a great weekend! Excited for #HUNTOBER2022 to continue on Tuesday!
