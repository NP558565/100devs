we are using the html+css template which was given to us via Leon.

in the template we have defined our header and footer in the HTML.

within the header and footer we have added 3 sections(top+middle+bottom)

in the CSS file we write how we want the footer, section, header to look on the page, 
by adding the css styles

always at the bottom of the css file we write / define our media queries, 
media quiries are implemented on the site/s so that the webpage can be seen
clear, on mobile as well as desktop devices, when you shrink the webpage
it still shows the infor on the website, no matter what device.

if we do not add media queries on a css document, and we then try to show the 
page on a device, when trying to shrink the browser, it would not show the full page,
and it would break, when also trying to shrink the browser on adesktop.
