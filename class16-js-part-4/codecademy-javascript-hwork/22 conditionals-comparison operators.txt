Comparison Operators
When writing conditional statements, sometimes we need to use different types of operators to compare values. 
These operators are called comparison operators.

Here is a list of some handy comparison operators and their syntax:

Less than: <
Greater than: >
Less than or equal to: <=
Greater than or equal to: >=
Is equal to: ===
Is not equal to: !==
Comparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right. For instance:

10 < 12 // Evaluates to true
It can be helpful to think of comparison statements as questions. When the answer is “yes”, the statement evaluates 
to true, and when the answer is “no”, the statement evaluates to false. The code above would be asking: is 10 less 
than 12? Yes! So 10 < 12 evaluates to true.

We can also use comparison operators on different data types like strings:

'apples' === 'oranges' // false
In the example above, we’re using the identity operator (===) to check if the string 'apples' is the same as the 
string 'oranges'. Since the two strings are not the same, the comparison statement evaluates to false.

All comparison statements evaluate to either true or false and are made up of:

Two values that will be compared.
An operator that separates the values and compares them accordingly (>, <, <=,>=,===,!==).

let hungerLevel = 7;
if (hungerLevel > 7) {
  console.log('Time to eat!');
} else {
  console.log('We can eat later!');
};
