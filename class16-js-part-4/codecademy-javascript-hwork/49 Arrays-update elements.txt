Update Elements
In the previous exercise, you learned how to access elements inside an array or a string by using an index. 
Once you have access to an element in an array, you can update its value.

let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];
 
seasons[3] = 'Autumn';
console.log(seasons); 
//Output: ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn']
In the example above, the seasons array contained the names of the four seasons.

However, we decided that we preferred to say 'Autumn' instead of 'Fall'.

The line, seasons[3] = 'Autumn'; tells our program to change the item at index 3 of the seasons array to 
be 'Autumn' instead of what is already there.

let groceryList = ['bread', 'tomatoes', 'milk'];

groceryList[1] = 'avocados';
