The Increment and Decrement Operator
Other mathematical assignment operators include the increment operator (++) and decrement operator (--).

The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. The decrement operator will decrease 
the value of the variable by 1. For example:

let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11
let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19
Just like the previous mathematical assignment operators (+=, -=, *=, /=), the variableâ€™s value is updated 
and assigned as the new value of that variable.
