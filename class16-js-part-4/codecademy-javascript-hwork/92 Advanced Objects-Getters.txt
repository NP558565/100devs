Getters
=================================================================================================================
Getters are methods that get and return the internal properties of an object. But they can do more than just 
retrieve the value of a property! Let’s take a look at a getter method:

const person = {
  _firstName: 'John',
  _lastName: 'Doe',
  get fullName() {
    if (this._firstName && this._lastName){
      return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
    } else {
      return 'Missing a first name or a last name.';
    }
  }
}
 
// To call the getter method: 
person.fullName; // 'John Doe'
Notice that in the getter method above:

We use the get keyword followed by a function.
We use an if...else conditional to check if both _firstName and _lastName exist (by making sure they both 
return truthy values) and then return a different value depending on the result.
We can access the calling object’s internal properties using this. In fullName, we’re accessing both 
this._firstName and this._lastName.
In the last line we call fullName on person. In general, getter methods do not need to be called with 
a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks like we’re accessing a property.
Now that we’ve gone over syntax, let’s discuss some notable advantages of using getter methods:

Getters can perform an action on the data when getting a property.
Getters can return different values using conditionals.
In a getter, we can access the properties of the calling object using this.
The functionality of our code is easier for other developers to understand.
Another thing to keep in mind when using getter (and setter) methods is that properties cannot share the 
same name as the getter/setter function. If we do so, then calling the method will result in an infinite 
call stack error. One workaround is to add an underscore before the property name like we did in the example above.


Instructions
1.
In robot, create a getter method named energyLevel using the get keyword. Leave function body blank for now.
2.
Inside the getter method, add an if statement to check if this._energyLevel is a number using the typeof operator. 
If that condition is truthy, return 'My current energy level is ENERGYLEVEL'. Replace ENERGYLEVEL with the value of 
this._energyLevel.
Make sure you return the string and not logging it to the console.
3.
If this._energyLevel isn’t a number it could be that the _energyLevel property was altered. Let’s add a default 
return statement for when such a scenario arises.
Add an else statement that returns 'System malfunction: cannot retrieve energy level'.
4.
Log the result of calling the getter method energyLevel on robot to the console.
Notice that the method will return a formatted response rather than just accessing a property!

const robot = {
  _model: '1E78V2',
  _energyLevel: 100,
  get energyLevel(){
    if(typeof this._energyLevel === 'number') {
      return 'My current energy level is ' + this._energyLevel
    } else {
      return "System malfunction: cannot retrieve energy level"
    }
  }
};
console.log(robot.energyLevel);

Setters
======================================================================================================================
Setters
Along with getter methods, we can also create setter methods which reassign values of existing properties 
within an object. Let’s see an example of a setter method:

const person = {
  _age: 37,
  set age(newAge){
    if (typeof newAge === 'number'){
      this._age = newAge;
    } else {
      console.log('You must assign a number to age');
    }
  }
};
Notice that in the example above:

We can perform a check for what value is being assigned to this._age.
When we use the setter method, only values that are numbers will reassign this._age
There are different outputs depending on what values are used to reassign this._age.
Then to use the setter method:

person.age = 40;
console.log(person._age); // Logs: 40
person.age = '40'; // Logs: You must assign a number to age
Setter methods like age do not need to be called with a set of parentheses. Syntactically, it looks 
like we’re reassigning the value of a property.

Like getter methods, there are similar advantages to using setter methods that include checking input, 
performing actions on properties, and displaying a clear intention for how the object is supposed to be used. 
Nonetheless, even with a setter method, it is still possible to directly reassign properties. For example, 
in the example above, we can still set ._age directly:

person._age = 'forty-five'
console.log(person._age); // Prints forty-five

Instructions
1.
Currently, in robot there is a getter method for numOfSensors but no setter method! What if we need to add 
or remove some sensors? Let’s fix that problem.
Add a setter method named numOfSensors using the set keyword. Provide a parameter of num. Leave the function 
body empty for now.
2.
There are a couple of things we should do in the setter method:
Add a check to see if num is a number using the typeof operator.
num should also be greater than or equal to 0.
If both conditions are met, reassign this._numOfSensors to num.
3.
Now add an else that logs 'Pass in a number that is greater than or equal to 0' to the console.
4.
Use the numOfSensors setter method on robot to assign _numOfSensors to 100.
5.
To check that the setter method worked, console.log() robot.numOfSensors.

const robot = {
  _model: '1E78V2',
  _energyLevel: 100,
  _numOfSensors: 15,
  get numOfSensors(){
    if(typeof this._numOfSensors === 'number'){
      return this._numOfSensors;
    } else {
      return 'Sensors are currently down.'
    }
  },
  set numOfSensors(num) {
    if (typeof num === 'number' && num >= 0){
      this._numOfSensors = num;
    } else {
      console.log('Pass in a number that is greater than or equal to 0')
    }   
  } 
};

robot.numOfSensors = 100;
console.log(robot.numOfSensors);
