typeof operator
While writing code, it can be useful to keep track of the data types of the variables in your program. 
If you need to check the data type of a variable’s value, you can use the typeof operator.

The typeof operator checks the value to its right and returns, or passes back, a string of the data type.

const unknown1 = 'foo';
console.log(typeof unknown1); // Output: string
 
const unknown2 = 10;
console.log(typeof unknown2); // Output: number
 
const unknown3 = true; 
console.log(typeof unknown3); // Output: boolean
Let’s break down the first example. Since the value unknown1 is 'foo', a string, typeof unknown1 will 
return 'string'.
