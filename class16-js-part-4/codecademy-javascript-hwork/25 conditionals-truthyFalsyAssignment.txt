Truthy and Falsy Assignment
Truthy and falsy evaluations open a world of short-hand possibilities!

Say you have a website and want to take a userâ€™s username to make a personalized greeting. Sometimes, the user 
does not have an account, making the username variable falsy. The code below checks if username is defined and 
assigns a default string if it is not:

let username = '';
let defaultName;
 
if (username) {
  defaultName = username;
} else {
  defaultName = 'Stranger';
}
 
console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger
If you combine your knowledge of logical operators you can use a short-hand for the code above. In a boolean 
condition, JavaScript assigns the truthy value to a variable if you use the || operator in your assignment:

let username = '';
let defaultName = username || 'Stranger';
 
console.log(defaultName); // Prints: Stranger
Because || or statements check the left-hand condition first, the variable defaultName will be assigned the 
actual value of username if it is truthy, and it will be assigned the value of 'Stranger' if username is falsy. 
This concept is also referred to as short-circuit evaluation.

let tool = '';

tool = 'marker';

// Use short circuit evaluation to assign writingUtensil variable below:
let writingUtensil = tool || 'pen';

console.log(`The ${writingUtensil} is mightier than the sword.`);
