The .findIndex() Method
We sometimes want to find the location of an element in an array. That’s where the .findIndex() method comes 
in! Calling .findIndex() on an array will return the index of the first element that evaluates to true in the 
callback function.

const jumbledNums = [123, 25, 78, 5, 9]; 
 
const lessThanTen = jumbledNums.findIndex(num => {
  return num < 10;
});
jumbledNums is an array that contains elements that are numbers.
const lessThanTen = declares a new variable that stores the returned index number from invoking .findIndex().
The callback function is an arrow function that has a single parameter, num. Each element in the jumbledNums 
array will be passed to this function as an argument.
num < 10; is the condition that elements are checked against. .findIndex() will return the index of the first 
element which evaluates to true for that condition.
Let’s take a look at what lessThanTen evaluates to:

console.log(lessThanTen); // Output: 3 
If we check what element has index of 3:

console.log(jumbledNums[3]); // Output: 5
Great, the element in index 3 is the number 5. This makes sense since 5 is the first element that is less than 10.

If there isn’t a single element in the array that satisfies the condition in the callback, then .findIndex() will 
return -1.

const greaterThan1000 = jumbledNums.findIndex(num => {
  return num > 1000;
});
 
console.log(greaterThan1000); // Output: -1




Invoke .findIndex() on the animals array to find the index of the element that has the value 'elephant' and 
save the returned value to a const variable named foundAnimal.

Let’s see if we can find the index of the first animal that starts with the letter 's'.
Call .findIndex() on the animals array and return the index of the first element that starts with 's'. 
Assign the returned value to a const variable named startsWithS.



const animals = ['hippo', 'tiger', 'lion', 'seal', 'cheetah', 'monkey', 'salamander', 'elephant'];

const foundAnimal = animals.findIndex(animal => {
  return animal === 'elephant';
});

const startsWithS = animals.findIndex(animal => {
  return animal[0] === 's' ? true : false;
});
