Methods
Remember that methods are actions we can perform. JavaScript provides a number of string methods.

We call, or use, these methods by appending an instance with:

a period (the dot operator)
the name of the method
opening and closing parentheses
E.g. 'example string'.methodName().

Does that syntax look a little familiar? When we use console.log() we’re calling the .log() method on the 
console object. Let’s see console.log() and some real string methods in action!

console.log('hello'.toUpperCase()); // Prints 'HELLO'
console.log('Hey'.startsWith('H')); // Prints true
Let’s look at each of the lines above:

On the first line, the .toUpperCase() method is called on the string instance 'hello'. The result is 
logged to the console. This method returns a string in all capital letters: 'HELLO'.
On the second line, the .startsWith() method is called on the string instance 'Hey'. This method also 
accepts the character 'H' as an input, or argument, between the parentheses. Since the string 'Hey' does 
start with the letter 'H', the method returns the boolean true.
You can find a list of built-in string methods in the JavaScript documentation. Developers use 
documentation as a reference tool. It describes JavaScript’s keywords, methods, and syntax.
