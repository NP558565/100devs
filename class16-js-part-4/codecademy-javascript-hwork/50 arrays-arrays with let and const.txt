Arrays with let and const
You may recall that you can declare variables with both the let and const keywords. Variables declared 
with let can be reassigned.

Variables declared with the const keyword cannot be reassigned. However, elements in an array declared 
with const remain mutable. Meaning that we can change the contents of a const array, but cannot reassign 
a new array or a different value.

The instructions below will illustrate this concept more clearly. Pay close attention to the similarities 
and differences between the condiments array and the utensils array as you complete the steps.

let condiments = ['Ketchup', 'Mustard', 'Soy Sauce', 'Sriracha'];

const utensils = ['Fork', 'Knife', 'Chopsticks', 'Spork'];

condiments[0] = 'Mayo';

console.log(condiments);

condiments = ['Mayo'];

utensils[3] = 'Spoon';

console.log(utensils);
