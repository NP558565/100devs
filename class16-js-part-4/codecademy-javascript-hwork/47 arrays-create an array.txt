Create an Array
One way we can create an array is to use an array literal. An array literal creates an array by wrapping 
items in square brackets []. Remember from the previous exercise, arrays can store any data type — we can 
have an array that holds all the same data types or an array that holds different data types.

Diagram outlining an array literal that has 3 separate elements, a comma separates each element (a string, 
a number, and a boolean) and the elements are wrapped with square brackets
Let’s take a closer look at the syntax in the array example:

The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
Each content item inside an array is called an element.
There are three different elements inside the array.
Each element inside the array is a different data type.
We can also save an array to a variable. You may have noticed we did this in the previous exercise:

let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];

const hobbies = ['kayaking', 'snowboarding', 'napping'];
console.log(hobbies);
