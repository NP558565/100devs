Nested Arrays
Earlier we mentioned that arrays can store other arrays. When an array contains another array it is known as a 
nested array. Examine the example below:

const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]];
To access the nested arrays we can use bracket notation with the index value, just like we did to access any 
other element:

const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]];
 
console.log(nestedArr[1]); // Output: [2, 3]
Notice that nestedArr[1] will grab the element in index 1 which is the array [2, 3]. Then, if we wanted to 
access the elements within the nested array we can chain, or add on, more bracket notation with index values.

const nestedArr = [[1], [2, 3]];
 
console.log(nestedArr[1]); // Output: [2, 3]
console.log(nestedArr[1][0]); // Output: 2
In the second console.log() statement, we have two bracket notations chained to nestedArr. We know that 
nestedArr[1] is the array [2, 3]. Then to grab the first element from that array, we use nestedArr[1][0] 
and we get the value of 2.

const numberClusters = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]];

const target = numberClusters[2][1];
