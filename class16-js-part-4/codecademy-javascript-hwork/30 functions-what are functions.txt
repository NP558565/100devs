What are Functions?
When first learning how to calculate the area of a rectangle, thereâ€™s a sequence of steps to calculate the correct answer:

Measure the width of the rectangle.
Measure the height of the rectangle.
Multiply the width and height of the rectangle.
With practice, you can calculate the area of the rectangle without being instructed with these three steps every time.

We can calculate the area of one rectangle with the following code:

const width = 10;
const height = 6;
const area =  width * height;
console.log(area); // Output: 60
Imagine being asked to calculate the area of three different rectangles:

// Area of the first rectangle
const width1 = 10;
const height1 = 6;
const area1 =  width1 * height1;
 
// Area of the second rectangle
const width2 = 4;
const height2 = 9;
const area2 =  width2 * height2;
 
// Area of the third rectangle
const width3 = 10;
const height3 = 10;
const area3 =  width3 * height3;
In programming, we often use code to perform a specific task multiple times. Instead of rewriting the same code, 
we can group a block of code together and associate it with one task, then we can reuse that block of code whenever 
we need to perform the task again. We achieve this by creating a function. A function is a reusable block of code 
that groups together a sequence of statements to perform a specific task.

In this lesson, you will learn how to create and use functions, and how they can be used to create clearer and more concise code.

5. Function
Here, we want you to write a function called capitalize that takes 2 parameters first_name and last_name
How to define a function 
Now you need to write the code inside your function.
You need to take the first letter of first_name and make it upcase
Same with the first letter of last_name
To finish, you need to return the concatenation of first_name and last_name capitalized!
Do not forget the " " between those 2 variables :)
To access the first letter, you can use the charAt()
To upcase a letter, you can use the toUpperCase()
To access the everything except the first letter, you can use substring
Incorporate all of that in your function 
View Solution
const capitalize = (first_name, last_name) => {
  const first = first_name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + first_name.substring(1);
  const last = last_name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + last_name.substring(1);
  return first + " " + last
}
