If Statement
We often perform a task based on a condition. For example, if the weather is nice today, then we will go outside. 
If the alarm clock rings, then we’ll shut it off. If we’re tired, then we’ll go to sleep.

In programming, we can also perform a task based on a condition using an if statement:

if (true) {
  console.log('This message will print!'); 
}
// Prints: This message will print!
Notice in the example above, we have an if statement. The if statement is composed of:

The if keyword followed by a set of parentheses () which is followed by a code block, or block statement, 
indicated by a set of curly braces {}.
Inside the parentheses (), a condition is provided that evaluates to true or false.
If the condition evaluates to true, the code inside the curly braces {} runs, or executes.
If the condition evaluates to false, the block won’t execute.

3. Conditional
Let’s start by defining a variable word that has a string for value, any word you want.
Now you need to test if word starts with the letter "B".
It it does, you should output true to the console, otherwise you should output false in the console.
To help you, you can use the startsWith() Javascript function.
eg: "Benjamin".startsWith("B") will return true
If you do not remember the syntax of an if else in Javascript:
    if (condition) {
        code if the condition is true;
    } else {
        code if condition is false;
    }
View Solution
 if (word.startsWith("B") === true) {
      console.log(true);
  } else {
      console.log(false);
  }
 console.log(word.startsWith("B"));
The function startsWith() already returns us true or false meaning we actually don’t need to use a condition here
