Nested Loops
When we have a loop running inside another loop, we call that a nested loop. One use for a nested for loop is 
to compare the elements in two arrays. For each round of the outer for loop, the inner for loop will run completely.

Let’s look at an example of a nested for loop:

const myArray = [6, 19, 20];
const yourArray = [19, 81, 2];
for (let i = 0; i < myArray.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < yourArray.length; j++) {
    if (myArray[i] === yourArray[j]) {
      console.log('Both loops have the number: ' + yourArray[j])
    }
  }
};
Let’s think about what’s happening in the nested loop in our example. For each element in the outer loop 
array, myArray, the inner loop will run in its entirety comparing the current element from the outer array, 
myArray[i], to each element in the inner array, yourArray[j]. When it finds a match, it prints a string to 
the console.

Instructions
1.
Imagine you’re a big-wig programmer for a social media platform! You have been tasked with building a 
prototype for a mutual followers program. You’ll need two arrays of “friends” from two mock users so 
that you can extract the names of the followers who exist in both lists. Make a variable called 
bobsFollowers and set it equal to an array with four strings representing the names of Bob’s friends.

Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Make a variable called tinasFollowers and set it equal to an array with three strings representing 
the names of Tina’s friends. Make exactly two of these the same as two of the friends in the 
bobsFollowers array.

Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Create a third variable named mutualFollowers and set it to an empty array.

Checkpoint 4 Passed
4.
Create a nested loop that iterates through bobsFollowers as the array for the outer loop and 
tinasFollowers as the array for the inner loop. If the current element from the outer loop is 
the same as the current element from the inner loop, push that element into the mutualFollowers 
array.

// Write your code below
let bobsFollowers = ['Joe', 'Marta', 'Sam', 'Erin'];
let tinasFollowers = ['Sam', 'Marta', 'Elle'];
let mutualFollowers = [];

for (let i = 0; i < bobsFollowers.length; i++) {
  for (let j = 0; j < tinasFollowers.length; j++) {
    if (bobsFollowers[i] === tinasFollowers[j]) {
      mutualFollowers.push(bobsFollowers[i]);
    }
  }
};
