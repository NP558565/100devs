More Array Methods
There are many more array methods than just .push() and .pop(). You can read about all of the array methods that 
exist on the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) array documentation.

.pop() and .push() mutate the array on which they’re called. However, there are times that we don’t want to 
mutate the original array and we can use non-mutating array methods. Be sure to check MDN to understand the 
behavior of the method you are using.

Some arrays methods that are available to JavaScript developers include: .join(), .slice(), .splice(), .shift(), 
.unshift(), and .concat() amongst many others. Using these built-in methods make it easier to do some common tasks 
when working with arrays.

Below, we will explore some methods that we have not learned yet. We will use these methods to edit a grocery list. 
As you complete the steps, you can consult the MDN documentation to learn what each method does!

const groceryList = ['orange juice', 'bananas', 'coffee beans', 'brown rice', 'pasta', 'coconut oil', 'plantains'];

groceryList.shift('orange juice');
//console.log(groceryList);

groceryList.unshift('popcorn');
//console.log(groceryList);

console.log(groceryList.slice(1, 4));

//console.log(groceryList);

const pastaIndex = groceryList.indexOf('pasta');

console.log(pastaIndex);
