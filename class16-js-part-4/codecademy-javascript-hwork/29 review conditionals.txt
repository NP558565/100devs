Way to go! Here are some of the major concepts for conditionals:

An if statement checks a condition and will execute a task if that condition evaluates to true.
if...else statements make binary decisions and execute different code blocks based on a provided condition.
We can add more conditions using else if statements.
Comparison operators, including <, >, <=, >=, ===, and !== can compare two values.
The logical and operator, &&, or “and”, checks if both provided expressions are truthy.
The logical operator ||, or “or”, checks if either provided expression is truthy.
The bang operator, !, switches the truthiness and falsiness of a value.
The ternary operator is shorthand to simplify concise if...else statements.
A switch statement can be used to simplify the process of writing multiple else if statements. The break keyword 
stops the remaining cases from being checked and executed in a switch statement.
