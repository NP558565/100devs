Built-in Objects
In addition to console, there are other objects built into JavaScript. Down the line, you’ll build your own 
objects, but for now these “built-in” objects are full of useful functionality.

For example, if you wanted to perform more complex mathematical operations than arithmetic, JavaScript has 
the built-in Math object.

The great thing about objects is that they have methods! Let’s call the .random() method from the built-in 
Math object:

console.log(Math.random()); // Prints a random number between 0 and 1
In the example above, we called the .random() method by appending the object name with the dot operator, 
the name of the method, and opening and closing parentheses. This method returns a random number between 
0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).

To generate a random number between 0 and 50, we could multiply this result by 50, like so:

Math.random() * 50;
The example above will likely evaluate to a decimal. To ensure the answer is a whole number, we can take 
advantage of another useful Math method called Math.floor().

Math.floor() takes a decimal number, and rounds down to the nearest whole number. You can use Math.floor() 
to round down a random number like this:

Math.floor(Math.random() * 50);
In this case:

Math.random generates a random number between 0 and 1.
We then multiply that number by 50, so now we have a number between 0 and 50.
Then, Math.floor() rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.
If you wanted to see the number printed to the terminal, you would still need to use a console.log() statement:

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 50)); // Prints a random whole number between 0 and 50
To see all of the properties and methods on the Math object, take a look at the documentation here.

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));
console.log(Math.ceil(43.8));
console.log(Number.isInteger(2017));
