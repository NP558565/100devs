String Concatenation
Operators aren’t just for numbers! When a + operator is used on two strings, it appends the right string to 
the left string:

console.log('hi' + 'ya'); // Prints 'hiya'
console.log('wo' + 'ah'); // Prints 'woah'
console.log('I love to ' + 'code.')
// Prints 'I love to code.'
This process of appending one string to another is called concatenation. Notice in the third example we had 
to make sure to include a space at the end of the first string. The computer will join the strings exactly, 
so we needed to make sure to include the space we wanted between the two strings.

console.log('front ' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'front space'
console.log('back' + ' space'); 
// Prints 'back space'
console.log('no' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'nospace'
console.log('middle' + ' ' + 'space'); 
// Prints 'middle space'
Just like with regular math, we can combine, or chain, our operations to get a final result:

console.log('One' + ', ' + 'two' + ', ' + 'three!'); 
// Prints 'One, two, three!'

2. Concatenation
Let’s start by defining one variable, firstString to have the content Hello.
Let’s define a second variable secondString to have the content World!
Now try to output "Hello World!" in the console using your 2 variables.

console.log(firstString + " " + secondString);
