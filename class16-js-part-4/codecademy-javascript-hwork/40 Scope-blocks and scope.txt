Blocks and Scope
Before we talk more about scope, we first need to talk about blocks.

Weâ€™ve seen blocks used before in functions and if statements. A block is the code found inside 
a set of curly braces {}. Blocks help us group one or more statements together and serve as an 
important structural marker for our code.

A block of code could be a function, like this:

const logSkyColor = () => {
  let color = 'blue'; 
  console.log(color); // blue 
}
Notice that the function body is actually a block of code.

Observe the block in an if statement:

if (dusk) {
  let color = 'pink';
  console.log(color); // pink
}

const city = 'New York City';
function logCitySkyline(){
  let skyscraper = 'Empire State Building';
  return 'The stars over the ' + skyscraper + ' in ' + city;
}
console.log(logCitySkyline())
