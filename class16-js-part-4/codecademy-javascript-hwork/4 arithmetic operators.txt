Arithmetic Operators
Basic arithmetic often comes in handy when programming.

An operator is a character that performs a task in our code. JavaScript has several built-in arithmetic 
operators, that allow us to perform mathematical calculations on numbers. These include the following operators and their corresponding symbols:

Add: +
Subtract: -
Multiply: *
Divide: /
Remainder: %
The first four work how you might guess:

console.log(3 + 4); // Prints 7
console.log(5 - 1); // Prints 4
console.log(4 * 2); // Prints 8
console.log(9 / 3); // Prints 3
Note that when we console.log() the computer will evaluate the expression inside the parentheses and print 
that result to the console. If we wanted to print the characters 3 + 4, we would wrap them in quotes and 
print them as a string.

console.log(11 % 3); // Prints 2
console.log(12 % 3); // Prints 0
The remainder operator, sometimes called modulo, returns the number that remains after the right-hand 
number divides into the left-hand number as many times as it evenly can: 11 % 3 equals 2 because 3 fits 
into 11 three times, leaving 2 as the remainder.
