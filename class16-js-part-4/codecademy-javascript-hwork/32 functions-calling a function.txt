Calling a Function
As we saw in previous exercises, a function declaration binds a function to an identifier.

However, a function declaration does not ask the code inside the function body to run, it just declares the existence of 
the function. The code inside a function body runs, or executes, only when the function is called.

To call a function in your code, you type the function name followed by parentheses.

We can call the same function as many times as needed.
