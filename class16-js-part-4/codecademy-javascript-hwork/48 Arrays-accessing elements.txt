Accessing Elements
Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index. We can access individual 
items using their index, which is similar to referencing an item in a list based on the item’s 
position.

Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed, meaning the positions start counting from 0 rather than 1. 
Therefore, the first item in an array will be at position 0. Let’s see how we could access an 
element in an array:

In the code snippet above:

cities is an array that has three elements.
We’re using bracket notation, [] with the index after the name of the array to access the element.
cities[0] will access the element at index 0 in the array cities. You can think of cities[0] as 
accessing the space in memory that holds the string 'New York'.
You can also access individual characters in a string using bracket notation and the index. 
For instance, you can write:

const hello = 'Hello World';
console.log(hello[6]);
// Output: W
The console will display W since it is the character that is at index 6.

const famousSayings = ['Fortune favors the brave.', 'A joke is a very serious thing.', 'Where there is love there is life.'];

const listItem = famousSayings[0];

console.log(famousSayings[2]);

console.log(famousSayings[3]);
